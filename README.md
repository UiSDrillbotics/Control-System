# UiSDrillbotics2018

UiS Drillbotics is a student competition hosted by the SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) and their technical section DSATS (Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section) with the purpose of accelerating the development and implementation of advanced drilling automation technology. At the University of Stavanger (UiS), we are designing and constructing a small scale autonomous drilling rig to compete with other universities worldwide.

This code will be implemented as the main control system for our rig. It's currently a "work in progress". We will be working on implementing a automated controll system as well as a manual system for testing. A machiene learning approach will be implemented as time goes by.
